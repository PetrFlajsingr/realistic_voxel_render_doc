	abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

	abstract="This paper proposes algorithms for dealing with two essential problems encountered in generating continuous-tone images by the ray tracing method: speed and aliasing. These two factors are considered an Achilles' heel of the method and have been the main cause preventing the method from being widely used. The paper examines previous approaches to the problem and finally proposes a scheme based on the coherency of an auxiliary data structure imposed on the original object domain. Both simple spatial enumeration and a hybrid octree approach were investigated. 3DDDA (3D line generator) was developed for efficient traversing of both structures. It constitutes the essential factor providing a dramatic improvement (order of magnitude) in processing speed in comparison to other known ray tracing methods. In particular, processing time is found to be virtually independent of the number of objects involved in the scene. For a larger number of objects (around 1500), this method actually becomes faster than scan-line methods. In order to remove jags from edges, a scheme for identifying the edge orientation and the distance from a pixel center to the true edge has been implemented. The additional time required for antialiasing depends on the total length of the edges encountered in the scene, but is normally only a fractional addition to the time required to produce such a scene without antialiasing.",

	abstract = { Ray tracing is one of the most elegant techniques in computer graphics. Many phenomena that are difficult or impossible with other techniques are simple with ray tracing, including shadows, reflections, and refracted light. Ray directions, however, have been determined precisely, and this has limited the capabilities of ray tracing. By distributing the directions of the rays according to the analytic function they sample, ray tracing can incorporate fuzzy phenomena. This provides correct and easy solutions to some previously unsolved or partially solved problems, including motion blur, depth of field, penumbras, translucency, and fuzzy reflections. Motion blur and depth of field calculations can be integrated with the visible surface calculations, avoiding the problems found in previous methods. },

We apply ideas from screen-space and voxel cone tracing techniques to this data structure to efficiently sample radiance on world space rays, with correct visibility information, directly within pixel and compute shaders. From these primitives, we then design two GPU algorithms to efficiently gather real-time, viewer-dependent global illumination onto both static and dynamic objects. These algorithms make different tradeoffs between performance and accuracy. Supplemental GLSL source code is included.},
